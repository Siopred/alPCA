In version 2, alPCA_v2.r, the user can obtain forecasts for a 12-month planning horizon of any time series. To select the methods, applying the final results of the above paper, only 3 percentiles are taken into account. The 5th percentile if we want few, the 95th percentile if we want to consider almost all of them, and the 50th percentile if we want an intermediate number of them. In this case only the weights obtained from the scores of each selected configuration are used. The associated function file in this case is f_alPCA.monthly.r.

The average monthly data of CO2 mole fraction (co2-mm-mlo), which represents CO2 emissions, have been taken as an illustrative example. The series is obtained from daily averages and covers from 01/01/2000 to 31/12/2019 (20 years and 240 observations). The data are from the U.S. Governmentâ€™s Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division, and are available from the Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide website https://datahub.io/core/co2-ppm#data. When the algorithm is finished, it generates a 12x3 dimension
prediction matrix under the name result alPCA, the first column contains the predictions obtained with the 5th percentile, the second column those obtained with the 50th percentile and the last column those obtained with the 95th percentile.
